### 🌟 Overview of the Backend Architecture of PassGuard
The PassGuard backend is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database. It handles password management and user authentication, ensuring security and scalability.

- **Node.js and Express**: manage HTTP requests, routes, and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: stores user data and passwords in a flexible, schema-less format, with Mongoose used for data modeling.
- **JWT**: secures API endpoints, while bcrypt hashes passwords before storage.
- **API Endpoints**: provide RESTful services for operations like user login and password management.
- **Logging tracks key activities, and centralized error handling**: ensures robust security and performance.
